# MyIceCreamStore

The goal of this project was to create a simplified version of real life cashier software. 
This project / software was designed to create a GUI for an ice cream store. 
User will be able to use this GUI to automatically calculate the total amount of the orders, register and store
members information, and visualization of orders for customers.
There are 3 default toppings and 3 default flavors in this program. 10% discount will be given for all registered membership.
Membership can be registered under the "membership form". All member names and password will be stored into a database.
For simplicity, the database will be store in this project as a csv file ("membershipDatabase.csv").
